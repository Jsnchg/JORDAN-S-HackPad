# JORDAN-S-HackPad
This is for the AMD x HackClub blueprint initiative where aspiring teenagers from around the world can participate to design PCB's and earn supportive grants, this personal project is from Jordan, Malaysia and includes PCB, Schematics and Autodesk casing design

CAD Model:

This is the CAD model that i have produced, it's quite different to the original guide because i added a few modifications and changes to the design. I hope it is acceptable!

PCD:

This is my PCB, although through the eyes of a professional mine is quite awkward and faulty but i'm sure i can use this as an experience to strenghten my skills! If there is any feedback or advice do let me know!

Schematic:

And finally my Schematic! Had the most fun doing this one with connecting each compontent and setting footprints

BOM:
All of the parts used are based according to the guide so i didn't add or remove anything, i however modified the casing design and keys orientation to make it my own! I didn't really add anything extra because i am slightly afraid of messing anything up, anyway's nonetheless here is the full list of all the components used:

1. XIAO Series RF2404-DI x1
2. SW_Push x4
3. SK6812 x2

I really hope this is ok! Hoping to hear back from you guys soon.
